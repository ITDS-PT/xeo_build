XEO Build System Instructions

0) If the concatenator.jar does not exist, run ant -f build_concatenator.xml

1) Set the version and path to git repositories in ant/global.properties (xeo.buildnumber, xeo.git and xwc.git properties respectively, set the branches you want to build
 - You can build xeo with a specific branch and xwc with a different branch)
2) Run ant -f build.xml to create necessary structures
3) Run ant -f BuildProject.xml to generate the XAR file



NOTES : Currently it does not create tags in the repository nor does it copy the generated to XAR to anywhere
